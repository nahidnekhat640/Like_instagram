                    <p class="comment"><span>rumimevlana</span>Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet, has been 
                        called the greatest mystical poet of all time. During the last 25 years of his life,
                         Rumi composed over 70,000 verses of poetry collected in 2 distinct volumes. Poetry 
                         focusing on varied and diverse topics. His work covers deeply philosophical and
                          mystical, with poems of fiery soulful expression to passionate love verses filled
                           with yearning and desire in volume 1. And in his second volume, which is his
                            populist work, he switches to a work filled with anecdotes, life lessons, 
                            moral stories, stories from all three Abrahamic religions, popular topics of
                             the day and even satirical tales.</p>

                        (born June 12, 1929, Frankfurt am Main, Germany—died February/March 1945, 
                        Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, near Hannover), Jewish girl whose diary of her
                         family’s two years in hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands became 
                         a classic of war literature. <br>
                         The Frank family was transported to Westerbork, a transit camp in the Netherlands,
                          and from there to Auschwitz, in German-occupied Poland, on September 3, 1944, on 
                          the last transport to leave Westerbork for Auschwitz. Anne and Margot were 
                          transferred to Bergen-Belsen the following month. Anne’s mother died in early 
                          January, just before the evacuation of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945. It was 
                          established by the Dutch government that both Anne and Margot died in a typhus 
                          epidemic in March 1945, only weeks before the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, but 
                          scholars in 2015 revealed new research, including analysis of archival data and 
                          first-person accounts, indicating that the sisters might have perished in February
                           1945. Otto Frank was found hospitalized at Auschwitz when it was liberated by 
                           Soviet troops on January 27, 1945.</p>

                    <p class="comment"><span>mahatmagandhi</span>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian
                         lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent
                          resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British 
                          rule, and to later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the
                           world.<br>
                           Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was
                            challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate 
                            homeland for Muslims within British India.In August 1947, Britain granted 
                            independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions,
                             a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced 
                             Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence
                              broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official 
                              celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to 
                              alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes
                               to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 
                               1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay
                                out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Although the Government of India 
                                relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too
                                 resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those 
                                 besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India.</p>
